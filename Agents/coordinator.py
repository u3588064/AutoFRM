# This file is intentionally left blank.
# In the Autogen framework, the orchestration logic previously handled by a
# central coordinator agent is typically managed by the GroupChatManager
# and the overall script structure (e.g., in main.py), often guided by a
# UserProxyAgent and potentially custom speaker selection functions.
